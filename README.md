# Eclat-Algorithm
The ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) algorithm is used to identify frequent item sets in transactional data.
The Eclat algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for frequent itemset mining.

 It works by generating all possible itemset combinations and counting their support in the dataset.

 The algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to generate all possible combinations of itemsets. 

The Eclat algorithm can be faster than Apriori for datasets with a small number of items and a large number of transactions.
